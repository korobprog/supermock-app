# SuperMock Scripts

Automation, CI helpers and developer ergonomics live here.

## Suggested scripts
- `bootstrap.sh` – install dependencies, run database migrations, seed data
- `lint-all.sh` – run linting across workspaces
- `release.ts` – orchestrate semver tagging and changelog generation

Feel free to add more scripts as features mature.
